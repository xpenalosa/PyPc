# --- Example input 1 ---
#
# This file contains an example input for the pypc module. If the input is not
# parsed, an explanation for every line of input will be added as a comment.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Needs parsing
#   - Memory supports registers
#
# Input features:
#   - Code tags
#   - Register access
#
# Pseudo-code:
#   a = 5
#   while a > 0:
#     print(a)
#     a--

	BNZ $1, .LOOP_END   # if B is false exit loop
	OUT $0              # print A
	ADD $0, -1L, $0     # A = A - 1
	BNZ 1L, .LOOP       # jump to loop start
